        <p>A recent study by Dr. Nancy Wang Yuen, Dr. Stacy L. Smith, and the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative assessed Asian Pacific Islander (API) leads and speaking characters across 1,300 top-grossing films from 2007 to 2019. The study found that across the 51,159 speaking characters in the 1,300 top-grossing movies, 5.9% were API, which fell short of the 7.1% of the US population identifying as API. The report also found that the characters were heavily stereotyped, falling into token character roles, from sidekicks to villains.</p>

        <h1>30% Being Stereotyped</h1>
      </div>
      <div class="box">
        <p> In 2019, 30% of API primary and secondary characters were either the only one or interacted with no other API characters on screen.”
        These stereotypes have long-lasting effects on how Asian American women are seen in the real world. 2021’s Atlanta spa shooter—who killed eight people, six of whom were Asian women—claimed his “sex addiction” fueled his actions, furthering the idea that Asian women have been tied to hypersexualized stereotypes. With growing hate crimes against Asian Americans, Stop AAPI Hate reported that Asian women were nearly twice as likely as men to be victims of a hate crime.</p>

        <h1>8% of Television</h1>

      <div class="box">
        <p>The Center for Women in Television’s Boxed In report for the 2019-2020 season examined broadcast networks, basic and premium cable channels, and streaming services and found that Asian women made up 8% of major female characters on television, a 1% increase from the prior season. The UCLA-Hollywood Diversity 2021 Report – Film, which surveyed 185 films released via theaters and streaming services in 2020, also noted an increase of Asian roles close to being representative to the US population, with women approaching or exceeding the numbers of their male counterparts.</p>

        <p>The campaign to improve female representation in film has shown small but positive signs. According to the USC Annenberg Inclusion Initiative, in 2019, 10.6% of the top 100 grossing films of the year were from Female directors with the Center for the study of Women in Television & Film finding that 37% of 2019’s lead characters were women. It’s a development worth noting.
        However, across 1,335 directors over 12 years, 4.3% were female and 3.2% were Asian, and no change occurred in either of these figures over the 12-year time frame.
        the statistics regarding opportunities for Asian women paint a dimmer picture. Out of the last 1,300 major releases, only 1% of them were directed by women from underrepresented ethnic groups.</p>
